## Summary

This chapter introduces the Z-transform and its properties. It covers the region of convergence, inverse Z-transform, and applications to difference equations.

## Key Concepts

- [EXPLAINS] Z-transform (aliases: z transform, ZT, bilateral Z-transform)
  Derives and defines the Z-transform from first principles, including region of convergence.
- [USES] Difference equations (aliases: recurrence relation)
  Uses Z-transform to solve linear difference equations.

## Prerequisites

- Laplace transform
- Complex analysis
