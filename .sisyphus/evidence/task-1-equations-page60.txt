as well. In contrast, the interpretation of q-1 as a complex variable (z-1) is only 
possible for linear difference equations with constant coefficients.  
Properties of the Transformation

The transformation of Equation 2.3.18 is not bijective because several points in the 
s- plane are transformed at the same point in the z-plane. Nevertheless, we are 
interested in the s-plane being delimited between the two horizontal lines crossing 
the points

The complementary bands are outside the frequency domain of interest if the 
conditions of the Shannon theorem (Section 2.2.1) have been satisfied. 
Figure 2.15 gives a detailed image of the effects of the transformation 
for 
the points that are inside the “primary strip”.
