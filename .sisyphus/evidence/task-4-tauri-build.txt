Task 4: Tauri Desktop Shell Build Evidence
============================================

Date: 2026-02-27
Status: STRUCTURE CREATED - CARGO CHECK DEFERRED

Environment Check:
------------------
Rust/Cargo Status: NOT INSTALLED
- cargo --version: command not found
- rustc --version: command not found

Action Taken:
-------------
Per task instructions, Rust/Cargo is not available on this system.
Created complete Tauri v2 project structure with all required files:

Files Created:
- src-tauri/Cargo.toml (Tauri v2 dependencies configured)
- src-tauri/build.rs (Tauri build script)
- src-tauri/src/lib.rs (Backend spawning logic + Tauri setup)
- src-tauri/src/main.rs (Entry point)
- src-tauri/tauri.conf.json (Window config: 1280x800, title "Lazy Learn")
- src-tauri/capabilities/default.json (Permissions for shell spawning)

Configuration Details:
- Window Title: "Lazy Learn"
- Window Size: 1280x800 (resizable)
- Dev URL: http://localhost:5173 (Vite frontend)
- Frontend Dist: ../frontend/dist
- Backend Spawning: Configured in src/lib.rs (best-effort, app works without it)
- Python Backend: Spawned on startup via uvicorn on port 8000
- Backend Cleanup: Killed on window close

Next Steps:
-----------
Rust/Cargo installation required to run:
  cd src-tauri && cargo check

The Orchestrator should install Rust toolchain separately.
All project files are ready for compilation once Rust is available.
